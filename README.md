# DATA-ACQUISITION USING FTK IMAGER
This repository documents a digital forensic exercise focused on acquiring an image of a removable storage device using FTK Imager, a widely-used tool for digital evidence collection and analysis.

Project Overview

Title: Removable Media Acquisition with FTK Imager  

Author: Adenike Oluwabusola Oni  

Tool Used: [FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager)

This project demonstrates:

- Acquiring a disk image from a removable drive
